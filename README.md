**From Zero To Coder** provides a comprehensive guide to learning software programming using modern JavaScript. Get a broad perspective from the basics to advanced topics to experiment and learn.

* **Chapter One**: Explains how the web and computers work and introduces HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Each section includes links for further exploration.

* **Chapter Two**: Teaches programming through JavaScript, exploring basic algorithms and language features such as built-in types, generators, modules and classes.

* **Chapter Three**: Addresses core web technologies and JavaScript interaction with the browser. Basic 2D graphics with canvas, DOM manipulation, web workers, client-side routing and asynchronous programming.

* **Chapter Four**: Expands JavaScript knowledge to server-side programming using Node.js. A complete web server example with a single-page client application in vanilla JavaScript.

* **Chapter Five**: Demonstrates learning from data by implementing a neural network from scratch and a board of cell robots that learn independently to move. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and its manipulation via JavaScript are used to draw the neural network.

* **Appendix**: Provides an introduction to source control with Git, making the book self-contained for beginners without needing other resources.

This book targets both beginners and those looking to deepen their JavaScript and web development skills. The shown code maximizes the learning effect by not using any third-party JavaScript libraries. All code examples are *freely* available for download.
